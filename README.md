# Installation

Until webbot is fixed to be packaged in an executable, you will have to install python with its imports.

The imports are:

- [Webbot](https://webbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [PySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

You can install them by copy/paste these into the terminal

- `pip install webbot`
- `pip install pysimplegui`
