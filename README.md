# Adam-Downloader

Download all your Adam Workspace with this app.

## Installation

Until webbot is fixed to be packaged in an executable, you will have to install python with its imports.

Clone this repository or download the zip file.

Install packages with pip:

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## How it works

- Run main.py

The files will be saved by default in the Documents folder: `C:/Users/Public/Documents/Vorlesungen`. You can change the destination folder, but be sure it's a *public* folder.

Speficy in the GUI your credentials and the amount of lectures you want to download. I would prefere to list all of the lectures for the current semester, because it iterates the list in adam from top to bottom.

## Known Issues

All of the Issues listed below will be fixed by me in the next patches.

- Headless download doesn't work right -> for now you will see chrome GUI.

## TODO

- Add additional GUI for start and end of program.
- Add progress bar for download.
