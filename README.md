# Adam-Downloader

Download  all your Adam Workspace with this app.

# Installation

Until webbot is fixed to be packaged in an executable, you will have to install python with its imports.

The imports are:

- [Webbot](https://webbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [PySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

You can install them by copy/paste these into the terminal

- `pip install webbot`
- `pip install pysimplegui`

## How it works

- Run main.py

The files will be saved in de Documents folder: `C:/Users/Public/Documents`.

It will only Dowload the lecutres you put in the fields. You can't choose which elements to download. It will always download the whole lecture.

Be sure to always delete the downloaded files if you intend to restart the app or rebase them in a different directory of your needs.


## Known Issues

All of the Issues listed below will be fixed by me in the next patches.

- Don't leave spaces while typing.
- in the Field "Anzahl Vorlesungen" please only put numbers not letters.
- If the app isn't working as it should just delete the Data.txt file and try to run it again.

Also if python can't find the libraries mentioned above and you are sure the installation worked, you may have different python versions and haven't selected the right one with the installation.
